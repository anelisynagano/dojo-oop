OOP - Protection against brute force attacks

1- Create a class User
2- The constructor must take a password (no need for username in this exercise)
3- Implement an instance method login(password) (i.e: to be used like john.login('passworD123')
4- Return true if the password matches
5- Return false if the password is wrong
6- If the user submits a wrong password 3 times in a row the method will always return false (in real life it could be a good idea to send an email to the user asking to reset the password)
7- If the user logins successfully the number of failed attempts should be reset
